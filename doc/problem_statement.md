## Testing with Fake Iterable API Server

I've incorporated test cases for the Fake Iterable API Server to ensure its reliability and functionality. These tests cover various scenarios, including successful event tracking, invalid parameters, unauthorized requests, and more. By thoroughly testing the Fake API Server, I've ensured that it accurately mimics the behavior of the real Iterable API, providing a robust foundation for application development.

### Fake Iterable API Test Cases

1. **Successful Event Tracking**: Validates that the Fake API Server correctly tracks events and returns success responses.
2. **Invalid Parameters Handling**: Tests how the Fake API Server handles requests with missing or invalid parameters, ensuring proper error responses.
3. **Unauthorized Requests**: Verifies the behavior of the Fake API Server when receiving requests with invalid API keys, ensuring appropriate error handling.

### Current Status

Below is a GIF demonstrating the current status of the Iterable Integration application, including the functionality of the Fake Iterable API Server:
